    <string name="title6">Training in the heat: how to maintain productivity and not harm your health</string>
    <string name="desc6">Alas, not all gyms have climate control systems that
they are able to maintain optimal temperature and humidity indicators for training.
Tips for training in the heat:
1. Drink more fluids. Training in the heat leads to a significant increase in sweating and,
as a result, to the loss of a large amount of fluid.
2. Reduce the intensity of training. The more intense the workout, the more the pulse increases and
the more it affects the cardiovascular system
3. Drink sugary drinks. Since the active operation of thermoregulation mechanisms requires a large amount of energy,
many people feel tired in the heat.

        <item>Insert your legs into the hyperextension simulator, remove your hands behind your
            head. Keeping your back straight, lower the body and then lift it up.
            At the top point, look at the wall in front of you. Avoid jerks and sudden movements,
            perform the exercise smoothly and under control.
        </item>
        <item>Put your feet a little wider than the straightened shoulders, bring the shoulder
            blades together, turn the socks of the feet a little to the sides. Pull the pelvis back,
            bend slightly in the lower back and with an inspiration go into a squat. Keep your back
            straight, look forward.
            Sit down to the parallel of the hips with the floor. If the heels do not come off it,
            the knees do not wrap inwards, and the back remains straight, try to sit down lower. If
            at the same time the back is rounded, return to the previous position, that is, again
            make the hips parallel to the floor.
            Get out of the squat on the exhale.
        </item>
        <item>Sit on the bench, press your feet to the floor. Grasp the handle with a straight
            (emphasis on the back) or reverse (emphasis on the biceps) grip. You can change them
            every week. Bring your shoulder blades together, lower your shoulders, straighten your
            back.
            As you exhale, pull the handle up to touch the chest. The body does not bend back, the
            shoulders are lowered, the shoulder blades are brought together.
        </item>
        <item>Hold the dumbbells at arm\'s length. Lunge forward, touch the floor with the knee of
            the leg standing behind. Make sure that the front knee does not go beyond the sock.

            Stand up and lunge with the other leg. You can do these exercises in motion or, if the
            gym is crowded, on the spot.
        </item>
        <item>Put your left arm and knee on a support, for example, on a bench or a box. Straighten
            your back, lower your shoulders and arm with a dumbbell, bring your shoulder blades
            together.

            Pull the dumbbell up to your waist and lower it again. It is very important to pull it
            to the belt, not to the chest, not to raise your shoulders and not to spread your
            shoulder blades. Otherwise, you will shift the focus from your hands to your back
            muscles.
        </item>
        <item>Stand close to the barbell so that the neck is above the lacing of the sneakers. Sit
            down, pulling the pelvis back. Grasp the barbell with a straight grip slightly wider
            than the shoulders. Keep your back straight throughout the exercise.
            Lift the barbell, fully straighten in the hip joint, then return to the starting
            position.
        </item>
        <item>Find a support: a box, a bench, a stack of steps. Turn your back to her, put your
            hands on her, straighten your knees. Do a reverse push-up to parallel the shoulders with
            the floor, but not below. Return to the starting position.

        <item>1. Go to the barbell rack. Take it in such a way that the neck is on the upper part of
            the sternum and the front parts of the deltas
            \n2. At the same time, you can cross your arms or put them on the neck with a grip from
            above
            \n3. Take a couple of steps away from the counter, put your feet shoulder-width apart

        <item>1. Taking a comfortable fixed position in the simulator, put your feet on the platform

            the sides of the seat)

        </item>
        <item>1. The back should be pressed against the seat.
            \n2. It is impossible to shift and rise from the place during the exercise.
            \n3. For secure fixation and performing concentrated extension, grasp the handles or
            seat of the simulator.
            \n4. Bending your knees, place your ankles under the roller.
            \n5. Straighten your legs with an exhalation, then fix the position for a second.
            \n6. As you inhale, slowly lower your legs to the starting position.
        </item>
        <item>1. Feet should stand shoulder-width apart
            \n2. Sit down and grab the barbell using a straight grip (when the palms are pointing in
            your direction)
            \n3. The grip should be such that the hands are slightly apart from each other, the
            width of the shoulders
            \n4. Take a barbell and straighten up with it
            \n5. Then, slowly lower the body body forward so that the barbell is below knee level

        <item>1. Take a position on an inclined bench, adjusting the seat so that the neck is at eye
            level.
            \n2. When performing a bench press, the neck should move at the level of the upper line
            of the pectoral muscles (or above the upper part of the pectoral muscles). The grip in
            this exercise is identical to the classic grip when pressing on a horizontal bench.
            A wide grip, in which the hands are as close as possible to the weighting discs, can
            also be used, but do not forget that such an arrangement of hands on the neck is more
            traumatic.
            \n3. The correct grip implies the vertical position of the elbows at the lowest point of
            the amplitude. The back should be pressed against the back of the bench.
            \n4. The inhale is done at the moment when the barbell is above the head at the highest
            point of the amplitude, and is accompanied by lowering the barbell to the chest, and the
            exhale is done at the time of the press.
            \n5. Hands at the peak of the amplitude should not be straightened to the end, since
            when the arms are extended, the triceps are fully connected to the work. In the lower
            part of the amplitude, the neck should not touch the chest.
            \n6. An important point is the stretching of the chest with air. Due to this, the chest
            muscles stretch when inhaling, which gives a better muscle contraction.
        </item>
        <item>1. The bench is installed at an angle of 45 degrees
            \n2. Inhale and exhale, and on exhaling, without a jerk, raise your arm at the elbow
            \n3. It is not necessary to bend the arm until the dumbbell touches the arm – just as it
            is not necessary to achieve a straight arm at the end of the movement when extending
            \n4. Elbows remain motionless during execution – do not bring them back or to the sides
        </item>
        <item>1. To perform the exercise, you need to sit on a bench and put dumbbells on your
            knees, then take a lying position. With your knees, you need to push the dumbbells to
            your chest.
            \n2. The arms should be stretched up in front of the chest, and the dumbbells should
            touch each other. It is important to keep a small angle at the elbows.
            \n3. The movement begins with the dilution of dumbbells to the sides on inspiration. It
            is very important that the elbows look down. The end point of the amplitude is
            approximately parallel to the floor.
            \n4. At the lower point of the amplitude, a short pause should be made.
            \n5. After a pause at the bottom point, return the dumbbells to their original position
            on exhalation.
            \n6. The movement is performed only by means of contraction of the pectoral muscles.
            Perform the exercise in a concentrated manner.
        </item>
        <item>1. We take the starting position: the body is between the bars, the palms embrace them
            and look at each other, the back is straight, the gaze is directed forward
            \n2. On the inhale, we begin to move, bending our arms at the elbows
            \n3. The lowest point of movement is when the shoulders are almost at the same level
            with the bars
            \n4. At the bottom point, you should fix yourself for a couple of seconds, then, on
            exhalation, with the tension of the muscles of the press, make an ascent by unbending
            your arms
        </item>
        <item>1. Place the neck on special racks for French bench press, or hold the neck on your
            chest, place your palms on the neck along the width of the shoulder joints, and slowly
            lie down on your back. At the bottom point, lift the barbell up, fully straightening
            your elbows.
            \n2. Press the lower back to the bench, if it is impossible, put your feet on the bench,
            thus removing the deflection of the lumbar region.
            \n3. Hold the barbell over your shoulders, do not pull your elbows to the sides.
            \n4. As you inhale, lower the barbell to your forehead, but without touching it.
            Movement occurs only in the elbow joint.
            \n5. With an exhalation, straighten your elbows to the end, without taking them away
            when lifting through the sides.

            of leg muscles when pulling up
            \n4. Slowly pull up, keeping the deflection in the back
            \n5. Then stay at the top point for 1-2 seconds
            \n6. After that, start the descent from the projectile as slowly as possible
            \n7. The lower point should not be in full extension of the elbows
            \n8. Climb to the crossbar again
        </item>
        <item>1. The athlete must stand in front of the barbell, put his feet shoulder-width apart.
            \n2. The knees should be slightly bent.
            \n3. It is necessary to take the barbell with your palms shoulder-width apart, without
            bending your arms at the elbows, then straighten up. The starting position is as
            follows: the loin is slightly bent, the torso is tilted forward. The angle of
            inclination is approximately 30 degrees.
            \n4. The legs are bent at the knees. The muscles of the lower back should be in tension.
            \n5. The starting point of the amplitude of the barbell is at the athlete\'s knees, the
            end point of the amplitude is at the belt.
            \n6. In the initial movement, an inhalation is made, and when the barbell is pulled to
            the belt, an exhalation is made, after which, on the reverse return movement to the
            starting position, an inhalation is again made.
        </item>
        <item>1. Grasp the fingerboard crossbar with both hands. Turn the inside of the hands
            (palms) forward
            \n2. Make a deflection in the lower back, tilt the head 15-20 cm back
            \n3. By the strength of the back muscles (wings) pull the weight up or down the chest
        </item>
        <item>1. Stand in front of the barbell, put your feet on the width of the pelvis, grab the
            barbell with a grip slightly wider than the shoulders.
            \n2. Rise with a straight back, bend your elbows and lift the barbell to the upper chest
            (on the collarbone).
            \n3. Lower your elbows to the floor, do not lean your body back, hold your spine with
            the strength of the stabilizer muscles.
            \n4. Exhale and lift the barbell over your head, fully extending your elbows.
            \n5. As you inhale, gently lower the neck to the clavicle part of the chest without
            dropping the barbell.
        </item>
        <item>1. Take a position in front of the mirror, taking the barbell in your hands.
            \n2. The legs should stand shoulder-width apart.
            \n3. The arms with the neck are lowered to the bottom.
            \n4. The grip can be narrow, straight or wide. The location of the brushes on the neck
            creates an emphasis on a part of the target muscles: the wider the grip, the more the
            long head of the biceps works, and the narrower it is, the more the short head is worked
            out.
            \n5. Please note that the back should be straight throughout the exercise.
            \n6. The upward movement, lifting the barbell, is performed on exhalation.
            \n7. The peak of the amplitude will come at the moment when the arms are completely bent
            at the joints.
            \n8. With exhalation, the barbell descends to the hips.
            \n9. In any case, do not tilt the body to the sides.
        </item>
        <item>1.The athlete must place his feet at shoulder level. The back should be strictly in an
            upright position. Hands with dumbbells held by a neutral grip are placed on the sides
            along the hips. Elbow joints are straight.
            \n2. The movement begins on exhalation. The athlete bends his arms at the elbow joint,
            straining the shoulder muscles (biceps). Please note that the elbow joints should not
            move from their place throughout the exercise.
            \n3. The reverse movement should be performed on the inhale slightly slower than the
            upward movement.
        </item>
        <item>1. Starting position: adjust the angle of inclination of the bench in the position
            from 80 to 90 degrees
            \n2. On exhalation: strain the abdominal muscles and lower back, squeeze the dumbbells
            up in an arc
            \n3. On the inhale: after lingering at the top point for a second, we return the
            dumbbells to the starting position with a slow and controlled movement

        <item>1. Gently, as you inhale, lower the barbell until it touches the lower part of the
            chest.\n2. As you exhale, squeeze the barbell up.
            During the exercise, make sure that the barbell moves only in the vertical plane.
            The elbows are under the neck at the same time. Throughout the movement, the shoulder
            blades remain contracted, and the lower back is bent.
            On the inhale - slowly down, on the exhale - powerfully up.
        </item>
        <item>1. Take a position on an inclined bench, adjusting the seat so that the neck is at eye
            level.\n2. When performing a bench press, the neck should move at the level of the upper
            line of the pectoral muscles (or above the upper part of the pectoral muscles). The grip
            in this exercise is identical to the classic grip when pressing on a horizontal bench.
            The correct grip implies the vertical position of the elbows at the lowest point of the
            amplitude.\n3.The back should be pressed against the back of the bench.
        </item>
        <item>1. Sit on a bench and firmly rest your feet on the floor. With the effort of the body,
            throw the dumbbells on the hips
            \n2. Slowly lie down on the bench and at the same time straighten your arms with
            dumbbells up as you exhale
            \n3. Slightly bend your arms at the elbows, they should not be fully straightened
            \n4. Start slowly, feeling the careful stretching of the pectoral muscles, lower your
            arms to the level when the forearms become parallel to the floor
            \n5. Exhaling, with a sharp contraction of the pectoral muscles, return the dumbbells to
            the starting position
            \n6. Fix the peak contraction for 1 second, then repeat the movement until the end of
            the exercise
        </item>
        <item>1. Take the starting position with straight arms at the top point. The body should be
            positioned strictly vertically, and the elbows should be turned back
            \n2. As you inhale, lower yourself down as much as possible until your shoulders are
            level with your elbows. Hands should be close to the body, do not go back or to the
            sides. Take a break
            \n3. As you exhale, press down with a powerful contraction of the arm muscles until the
            elbow joints are fully straightened. Pause
        </item>
        <item>1. The neck is at eye level, the buttocks and shoulder blades touch the bench, the
            deflection is performed if it is convenient, and so the body is better stabilized on the
            bench. The \"bridge\" is not an end in itself in this bench press, as in other bench
            press movements;
            \n2. The feet can stand on their toes, or press against the floor, this moment depends
            on the height of the bench and the length of the athlete\'s legs. The main thing is a
            stable position of the legs so that they do not move along the \"perimeter\";
            \n3. The neck is taken with a closed grip, usually slightly narrower than the shoulders,
            but this is individual. The triceps also works with an average grip, if you do not
            \"twist\" your elbows to the sides and do not bend your wrists
        </item>
        <item>1.Lie down on the bench with the angle you have chosen. Take the barbell in your hands
            (by yourself, or let your partner give it), grip shoulder width apart. The shoulder
            blades are pressed against the surface on which you are lying, the legs are on the
            floor. The head is pressed down, lying closer to the edge of the bench.
            \n2. Lift the barbell up. This is a very important point. If you perform the option to
            the nose, then keep your hands perpendicular to the floor.
            \n3. We inhale and bend our arms at the elbow joint, thereby lowering the barbell to the
            point we have chosen, nose or behind the head.
            \n4. After fully lowering the barbell, immediately on exhalation, we unbend our arms and
            return them to their original position. Don\'t make any sudden movements.
        </item>
        <item>1. Stand facing the Crossover, take the straight handle of the upper block with a grip
            from above along the edges.
            \n2. Place your feet on the width of the pelvis and press your elbows to the body. The
            forearms are relaxed, the handle is at shoulder level.
            \n3. Exhale: perform the extension of the arms without lifting the elbows, lowering the
            handle completely on the hips.
            \n4. Inhale: bend your elbows smoothly and without a jerk.
        </item>
        <item>1. Place your legs under special rollers to fix the knee and ankle joints. The hips
            and buttocks should be in full contact with the inclined bench.
            \n2. Put your hands behind your head or hold them on your chest – this will simplify the
            load.
            \n3. Round your back at the top of the movement and do not unbend your spine until the
            end of the approach.
            \n4. As you inhale, pull the trunk back, keeping tension in the abdominal muscles, and
            lower it to such an extent that the angle between the trunk and the hips is about 90
            degrees. Do not lower your back on the bench, remember about the tension in the
            abdominal muscles and the rounding of the spine.
            \n5. With an exhalation, twist the press, bringing the stomach to the hips, but do not
            straighten your back.

            \n2. Stand in front of the barbell in the center, place your feet along the width of the
            pelvis, spread your socks apart quite a bit.
            \n3. Sit down, pulling the pelvis back, grab the barbell bar with your hands
            shoulder-width apart so that your knees are between your hands.
            \n4. Do not get up from the same position. To begin with, straighten the spine line,
            slightly bending the lower back inward, exposing the chest forward.
            \n5. The shoulder line should extend beyond the bar forward.
            \n6. Bring your shoulder blades together, keep your head neutral, do not rotate your
            head and do not throw it back.
            \n7. Before starting the movement, take a breath. Mainly due to the strength of the
            pelvis, begin to unbend the trunk and climb up until the spine and knees are fully
            straightened.
            \n8. Exhale at the top.
            \n9. Slowly return the barbell to the floor, stretching the neck along the shin, do not
            pull the pelvis back too far so that the load does not shift from the back.
        </item>
        <item>1. Standing, legs shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent (remove the load from the
            knees).
            \n2. Grasp the neck from below, slightly wider than the shoulders.
            \n3. Exhale: bend your arms, lifting the barbell due to biceps efforts.
            \n4. Inhale: gently lower the barbell down.
        </item>
        <item>1. Standing, legs shoulder-width apart, arms with dumbbells hanging freely at the
            sides.
            \n2. Exhale: lift the dumbbells, bending your elbows, keeping them pressed against the
            trunk. When the angle at the elbows reaches 90 degrees, begin to unfold the brushes with
            the inner side to the shoulders. Make an effort at the expense of the biceps, do not
            rock the body and do not lift the dumbbells with a jerk.
            \n3. Inhale: perform a slower lowering of the arms in reverse order, turning the hands
            to the starting position.
        </item>
        <item>1. Place your hands on the neck (middle position).
            \n2. The back is straight, the shoulders are straightened, the legs are shoulder width
            apart.
            \n3. From the position of straight, lowered arms, bending is performed.
            \n4. The upward movement occurs on exhalation. The hands are pressed against the body
            and motionless. Only the forearms move.
            \n5. Movements are performed in a concentrated manner, without jerks.
            \n6. At the upper point of the amplitude (it is achievable with full flexion of the arms
            in the elbow joints), you need to pause for a second, after which you return the barbell
            to its original position as slowly as possible. Please note that it is not necessary to
            fully straighten the arms in the elbow joints, as this is traumatic.
            \n7. At the lower point of the movement, a breath is inhaled and a repeat is performed.

            each other, avoiding their contact
            \n3. With the body fixed, while inhaling, we spread our arms to the sides and linger for
            a second
            \n4. As you exhale, gently and calmly lower your hands and continue moving without
            stopping
            \n5. The elbows are turned up during the exercise, they look at the ceiling, we do not
            reduce the shoulder blades, otherwise the trapezius muscles will immediately turn into
            work
            \n6. The body is motionless during the exercise and does not sway
        </item>
        <item>1. When performing the technique with a barbell in front, place the neck on the racks
            at a level just below the pelvis.
            \n2. Grasp the neck with a grip from above, slightly wider than the shoulders. Remove
            the barbell, move a little away from the racks and place your feet shoulder-width apart.
            \n3. With an exhalation, lift your shoulders, doing \'shrugs \', at the peak feel the
            maximum reduction of the trapezoid. Linger for a second at the peak of contraction.
            Perform the full range of motion.
            \n4. As you inhale, lower your shoulders, slowly stretching the trapezoids.
        </item>
        <item>1. Go to the barbell rack. Take it in such a way that the neck is on the upper part of
            the sternum and the front parts of the deltas
            \n2. At the same time, you can cross your arms or put them on the neck with a grip from
            above
            \n3. Take a couple of steps away from the counter, put your feet shoulder-width apart
            \n4. Take a breath and start going down. Continue the movement until the hips are
            parallel to the floor

        <item>1. Taking a comfortable fixed position in the simulator, put your feet on the
            platform. This will be the starting position.
            \n2. After that, remove the weight clamps using the levers (usually they are located on
            the sides of the seat).
            \n3. With the next movement, lower the weight of the platform by bending the legs at the
            knees. When performing this movement, you should inhale. At the lower point of the
            movement, the legs should form a right angle. It is very important not to take your feet
            off the platform, and your lower back off the back of the simulator.
            \n4. After that, from the lowest point of the amplitude, exhaling, push the platform up

        <item>1. Take a position on an inclined bench, adjusting the seat so that the neck is at eye
            level.
            \n2. When performing a bench press, the neck should move at the level of the upper line
            of the pectoral muscles (or above the upper part of the pectoral muscles). The grip in
            this exercise is identical to the classic grip when pressing on a horizontal bench.
            The correct grip implies the vertical position of the elbows at the lowest point of the
            amplitude.
            \n3.The back should be pressed against the back of the bench.
        </item>
        <item>1. The bench is installed at an angle of 45 degrees
            \n2. Inhale and exhale, and on exhaling, without a jerk, raise your arm at the elbow
            \n3. It is not necessary to bend the arm until the dumbbell touches the arm – just as it
            is not necessary to achieve a straight arm at the end of the movement when extending
            \n4. Elbows remain motionless during execution – do not bring them back or to the sides
        </item>
        <item>1. To perform the exercise, you need to sit on a bench and put dumbbells on your
            knees, then take a lying position. With your knees, you need to push the dumbbells to
            your chest.
            \n2. The arms should be stretched up in front of the chest, and the dumbbells should
            touch each other. It is important to keep a small angle at the elbows.
            \n3. The movement begins with the dilution of dumbbells to the sides on inspiration. It
            is very important that the elbows look down. The end point of the amplitude is
            approximately parallel to the floor.
            \n4. At the lower point of the amplitude, a short pause should be made.
            \n5. After a pause at the bottom point, return the dumbbells to their original position
            on exhalation.
            \n6. The movement is performed only by means of contraction of the pectoral muscles.
            Perform the exercise in a concentrated manner.
        </item>
        <item>1. Standing, legs shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent (we remove the load from
            the knees)
            \n2. Grasp the neck from below, slightly wider than the shoulders
            \n3. Exhale: bend your arms, lifting the barbell due to biceps efforts
            \n4. Inhale: gently lower the bar down
        </item>
        <item>1. The athlete must place his feet at shoulder level. The back should be strictly in
            an upright position. Hands with dumbbells held by a neutral grip are placed on the sides
            along the hips. Elbow joints are straight.
            \n2. The movement begins on exhalation. The athlete bends his arms at the elbow joint,
            straining the shoulder muscles (biceps). Please note that the elbow joints should not
            move from their place throughout the exercise.
            \n3. The reverse movement should be performed on the inhale slightly slower than the
            upward movement.
        </item>
        <item>1. The neck is at eye level, the buttocks and shoulder blades touch the bench, the
            deflection is performed if it is convenient, and so the body is better stabilized on the
            bench. \'Bridge\' is not an end in itself in this bench press, as in other bench press
            movements;
            \n2. The feet can stand on their toes, or press against the floor, this moment depends
            on the height of the bench and the length of the athlete\'s legs. The main thing is a
            stable position of the legs so that they do not move along the \'perimeter\';
            \n3. The neck is taken with a closed grip, usually slightly narrower than the shoulders,
            but this is individual. The triceps also works with an average grip, if you do not
            \'twist\' your elbows to the sides and do not bend your wrists
        </item>
        <item>1.Lie down on the bench with the angle you have chosen. Take the barbell in your hands
            (by yourself, or let your partner give it), grip shoulder width apart. The shoulder
            blades are pressed against the surface on which you are lying, the legs are on the
            floor. The head is pressed down, lying closer to the edge of the bench.
            \n2. Lift the barbell up. This is a very important point. If you perform the option to
            the nose, then keep your hands perpendicular to the floor.
            \n3. We inhale and bend our arms at the elbow joint, thereby lowering the barbell to the
            point we have chosen, nose or behind the head.
            \n4. After fully lowering the barbell, immediately on exhalation, we unbend our arms and
            return them to their original position. Don\'t make any sudden movements.
